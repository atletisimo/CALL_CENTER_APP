# CALL_CENTER_APP
This Java call center application simulates the operations of a basic call center. It allows agents to handle incoming calls from customers, categorizing calls based on their priority levels.

Customers can report issues or make inquiries, and these calls are assigned priorities: high, medium, or low. High-priority calls, such as critical system outages, are immediately routed to available agents for prompt resolution. Medium and low-priority calls, representing important but less urgent issues or general inquiries, are placed in a queue for handling as agents become available.

The application helps manage the workflow efficiently by ensuring that urgent matters are addressed promptly while also maintaining a systematic approach to handling less urgent requests. Additionally, it provides a structured environment for agents to manage and resolve customer issues effectively.
